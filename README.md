#QLCodeSnippets

I have accumulated lots of code snippets since 2 years ago.

Today i share it to you.

##Introductions

In the files:
- whose name has a prefix of `OC` defines a code snippet for Objective-C.
- whose name has a prefix of `SW` defines a code snippet for Swift.
- whose name has a prefix of `Define` defines a code snippet as a global micro such as color, screen size...
...

And you can also add something yourself.

##Usage
Now you can check it out and move it to your Xcode UserData folder.

- you can open the preferences of the Xcode, in the tab named `Locations`, you can find some open-folder guide button. click one of the them and it will show you a path in the finder. Assumed you pressed the button below `DerivedData`, so ,the finder will like this:
![DerivedData](http://git.oschina.net/uploads/images/2016/0321/110731_5cc5f842_573319.png "DerivedData path")
Open the folder named `UserData` at the same level of `DerivedData`, and you can move the file cloned floder named `CodeSnippets` to this path. if here already have the same name floder, copy the files in the `CodeSnippets` to the folder.

OK, We make it. So, restart your Xcode and Open a project, type `define`, what did you see? Ohh?
